# Karpen-Lab-Liver-Quant-2022
This repository contains all files for the BioProtocols submission (Current stage: Presubmission). Included are scripts for automated quantification of whole-slide scanned liver sections for the purpose of understanding differences in pathology within development and disease. 

Detailed use of each script is outlined within BioProtocol submission. 
  Briefly: After creating a new project within Qupath, move desired '.groovy' files into the 'scripts' folder. Within Qupath, the scripts should now be       available to use. Once the region of interest has been outlined (using the wand tool), click the script that matches the desired analysis (i.e.             Macrophages, Cholangiocytes, Fibrosis), and then run.
